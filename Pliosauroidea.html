								<p>Plesiosaurs are usually divided into two main types: those with small heads and long necks, and those with large heads and short necks. Liopleurodon belonged to the second group. Like all plesiosaurs, it had a short tail, a large body, and two pairs of big flippers.</p>
								<p>The Liopleurodon became famous in 1999 after appearing in the BBC series "Walking with Dinosaurs", where it was shown as a huge top predator about 25 meters long and weighing around 150 tons. This idea came from a single vertebra found near Peterborough, which a scientist named Martill used to estimate its size. At the time, this seemed believable, but it is now considered a big exaggeration. Later studies, including one by Martill himself, argued that even the largest pliosaurs were probably much smaller and not as big as modern whales. Some researchers also questioned whether the Peterborough bone really belonged to a pliosaur at all, and a 2019 study showed that it actually came from a different dinosaur.</p>

										<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronosaurus">Kronosaurus</a></h2>
										<p>An extinct genus of large short-necked pliosaur. Its name, meaning "lizard of Kronos", refers to its large size and  ferocity, like the Titan of the Greek mythology.</p>

								<p>Kronosaurus is one of the biggest pliosaurs ever discovered. At first, scientists thought it could grow up to about 13 meters long, based on a skeleton at Harvard. However, that skeleton was rebuilt with too many vertebrae, so later studies from the 2000s estimated its real length to be between 9 and a little over 10 meters. Like all plesiosaurs, Kronosaurus had four flipper-like limbs and a short tail. As with most pliosaurs, it also had a long head and a short neck.</p>
								<p>Its large, cone-shaped teeth suggest it hunted big prey. The front teeth were larger than the ones in the back. Kronosaurus’s limbs had evolved into flippers, with the rear pair being bigger than the front pair. Because of its large size, body shape, and wide range, it was probably the top predator in its environment.</p>
